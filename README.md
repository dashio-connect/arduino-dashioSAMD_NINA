# DashIO

So, what is **DashIO**? It is a quick effortless way to connect your IoT device to your phone, tablet or iPad using the free **Dash IoT** app. It allows easy setup of controls such as Dials, Text Boxes, Charts, Graphs, Notifications..., from your IoT device. You can define the look and layout of the controls on your phone from your IoT device. There are three methods to connect to your phone; Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), TCP or MQTT.

What is **dash** then? **dash** is an IoT platform based on an MQTT server with extra bits added in to allow you to store data, manage your devices, send notifications, share your devices, and save your **Dash** app setup.
